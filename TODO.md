- [x] add code to automatically save all variations
- [x] create graphs with only significant biomarkers (p-value < 0.05)
- [x] add some lines to the correlation matrices to make it easier to see blocks of interest
- [x] create graphs with only significant biomarkers (p-value < 0.25)
- [x] get an numerical version of the correlation matrices (like an excel file)
- [x] for R plots: find a way to increase size between each of the boxes
